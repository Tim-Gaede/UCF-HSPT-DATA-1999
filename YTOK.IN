Boss's Diary

12-18-99 Things are getting very hectic around the office
with the new year coming on us.  I've got a programmer
working on the Y2K problem, so at least I have that out of
my pointy hair.

12-22-99 I just finished firing a few employees before the
holidays.  Time for another wonderful christmas with the in-
laws.  I saw people buying guns in preparation for Y2K on
the news this morning.  I realize that a computer crash can
be annoying, but a couple of Y's is no excuse to turn to
violence.

01-01-00 Hooray, a new year for me to fire incompetent
employees.  I don't think Y2K was such a big deal.  I came
back to the office this morning, and everything was in
pristine order.
