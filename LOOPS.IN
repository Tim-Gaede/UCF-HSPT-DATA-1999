DON'T PROCESS THIS LINE OR YOU'LL BE SORRY. Not only does it have non-fruitname characters, it also happens to be fairly long. It might overflow any sort of built-in string and cause your program to generate too much output. That would not be a gOOd thing, because then you'd have to fix it and submit again. DARN!
