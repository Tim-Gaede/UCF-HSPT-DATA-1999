12-18-99 Things are getting verk hectic around the office
with the new kear coming on us.  I've got a programmer
working on the K2K problem, so at least I have that out of
mk pointk hair.

12-22-99 I just finished firing a few emplokees before the
holidaks.  Time for another wonderful christmas with the in-
laws.  I saw people buking guns in preparation for K2K on
the news this morning.  I realize that a computer crash can
be annoking, but a couple of K's is no excuse to turn to
violence.

01-01-00 Hoorak, a new kear for me to fire incompetent
emplokees.  I don't think K2K was such a big deal.  I came
back to the office this morning, and everkthing was in
pristine order.
